# Platformer

Project: Platformer

You will create a ​simple​ platformer game! Your game will feature a character that can move and jump. Your game will also have some sort of hazard as well as a moving platform. All of this will take place across 3 levels of your own design. You are welcome to use art assets that you can find however, ​all of the code must be your own!​
